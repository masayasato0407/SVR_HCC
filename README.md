# SMART model: Prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma development after the eradication of hepatitis C virus with antivirals
This is a novel prediction model for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence in patients after hepatitis C virus eradication was developed using machine learning algorithms. 

Enter the following information.
1. age
2. Body mass index (height [cm] and body weight [kg])
3. Platelet count (×10^4/µL)
4. AFP level (ng/mL)
5. Serum albumin level (g/dL)
6. AST level (IU/L)
7. γ-GTP level (IU/L)

Then the prediction curve for the development of HCC for each patient, as predicted by the machine learning model (SMART model), is displayed individually. 
This model, using seven commonly measured parameters could provide a personalized surveillance system.
