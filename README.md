# SMART model: Prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma development after the eradication of hepatitis C virus with antivirals
This is a novel prediction model for HCC occurrence in patients after hepatitis C virus eradication was developed using machine learning algorithms. This model, using seven commonly measured parameters, has been shown to have a good predictive ability for HCC development and could provide a personalized surveillance system.
