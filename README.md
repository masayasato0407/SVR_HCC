# SMART model: Prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma development after the eradication of hepatitis C virus with antivirals
This is a novel prediction model for HCC occurrence in patients after hepatitis C virus eradication was developed using machine learning algorithms. This model, using seven commonly measured parameters could provide a personalized surveillance system. 

Enter the following information
1. age
2. Body mass index (height [cm] and body weight [kg])
3. Platelet count (×10^4/µL)
4. AFP level (ng/mL)
5. Serum albumin level (g/dL)
6. AST level (IU/L)
7. γ-GTP level (IU/L)
